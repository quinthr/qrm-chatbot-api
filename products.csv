<p>Mass Loaded Vinyl, or NuWave Base, or just MLV, is a high performance, flexible soundproofing barrier from Thermotec Australia, treated for UV radiation for fence insulation.</p>
<p>With an ultra thin profile of 2mm (approximately) and high acoustic performance of Rw 26*, Mass Loaded Vinyl is an excellent product to soundproof <b>outdoor walls and fences at home.</b></p>
<p>Mass loaded Vinyl is also commonly used in a wide variety of other applications such as soundproofing <strong>cars, boats, pump housings, machinery rooms</strong> or other industrial applications.</p>
<p>Mass Loaded Vinyl (MLV) is dark grey or black in colour and Supplied in a roll, 5 meters long by 1350mm wide, weighing approximately 28kg.</p>
<h2>Mass Loaded Vinyl Installation:</h2>
<p>Mass Loaded Vinyl  is very easy to cut and install. The product contains a fabric scrim with an embossed face increasing  tear resistance whilst maintaining high flexibility.</p>
<p>External Walls / Fence – the product should be tacked to studs / joists using tacks with large heads or incorporating a washer to minimize tear. Gluing is also beneficial.</p>
<p>Mass Loaded Vinyl (MLV) can be glued to machinery housings, pump housings, boat or car structures to increase the mass and reduce sound transmission.</p>
<p>Sheets should be butted up against each other, or overlapped and taped using a a strong industrial tape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mass Loaded Vinyl for Sound Fence Insulation Composition:</h2>
<p>Mass Loaded Vinyl is comprised of 3 elements.</p>
<p>First, vinyl is employed to provide the product with a high level of flexibility for ease of use.</p>
<p>Second, the Vinyl is impregnated with naturally occurring Barium Sulphate, a non toxic nature and high relative density substance. It is this high relative density (mass) that gives Mass Loaded Vinyl such effective soundproofing capabilities.</p>
<p>Finally, the vinyl and barium mixture is added to a reinforcing scrim to increase the products tensile strength</p>
