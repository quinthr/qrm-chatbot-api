  "conversation_date": "2025-01-17",
  "session_summary": "Continued work on QRM Chatbot API from previous conversation. Implemented shipping class rates integration for product-specific shipping costs. Made product URLs clickable, added 'from' pricing for variable products, fixed shipping method titles, and implemented comprehensive shipping class-based cost calculations.",
  "main_issues_addressed": {
    "shipping_class_integration": {
      "problem": "Need product-specific shipping costs based on shipping classes",
      "solution": "Added ShippingClassRate model and get_shipping_options_for_products() method",
      "implementation": [
        "Added ShippingClassRate model to db_models.py",
        "Implemented get_shipping_options_for_products() method",
        "Added _extract_numeric_cost() helper for parsing costs",
        "Updated ChatService to use product-aware shipping when products found",
        "Uses highest rate when multiple shipping classes apply"

      "status": "✅ Implemented and pushed to GitHub"

      "problem": "Product URLs not clickable in chatbot responses",
      "solution": "Updated system prompt to use HTML anchor tags instead of markdown",

    },
    "shipping_method_titles": {
      "problem": "Showing generic 'Flat rate' instead of proper shipping method names",
